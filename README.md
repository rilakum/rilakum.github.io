# Wiru Stroll
Stroll is a internet browser project by Wiru Inc. (unregistered company by Hiro Park, rilakum on github).

Currently Stroll is JavaScript based browser. It works currently by basically redirecting your search to google... not very convienent. None the less it's was pretty amazing to start with something "semi-functional". Plans are now to make Stroll operate on its own without the assistance of a second browser ^^


If you'd like to help please feel free to add on or message me.
